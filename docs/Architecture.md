# Architecture

## Overview

BuyMyLove GiftList is a single-page web application for managing and sharing gift ideas. It supports anonymous users (for marking gifts as bought) and admin users (for managing the gift list) via OTP email login. The backend is powered by Supabase (Edge Functions, Auth, and Storage).

    participant Admin as Admin User (Browser)
    participant UI as GiftForm
    participant Edge as Supabase Edge Function
    participant DB as Supabase DB
    participant Storage as Supabase Storage

    Admin->>UI: Fill form (add/update/delete)
    UI->>Edge: Call add-gift/update-gift/delete-gift (with JWT)
    Edge->>DB: Insert/Update/Delete gift row
    Edge-->>UI: Success/Error
    UI->>Storage: (optional) Upload/Delete image

### 3. Anonymous User: Toggle Bought Status

```mermaid

    participant Edge as Supabase Edge Function
    participant DB as Supabase DB

    User->>UI: Click "Mark as bought"
    UI->>Edge: Call toggle-bought-status (with cookie ID)
    Edge->>DB: Update bought status for gift
    Edge-->>UI: Success/Error

### 4. Admin Login Flow (OTP)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Admin User (Browser)
    participant UI as AuthForm
    participant Supabase as Supabase Auth

    Admin->>UI: Enter email, submit login
    UI->>Supabase: signInWithOTP(email)
    Supabase-->>Admin: Email with login link
    Admin->>Supabase: Click link, authenticate
    Supabase-->>UI: Session established
    UI-->>Admin: Show admin panel

## Key Components

- **GiftList**: Displays all gifts, allows anonymous users to mark as bought.
- **GiftForm**: Admin-only, for adding/updating/deleting gifts and images.
- **AuthForm**: Handles admin OTP login/logout.
- **Supabase Edge Functions**: Secure backend logic for all gift actions.
- **Supabase Storage**: Stores and serves gift images.
- **Supabase Auth**: Handles admin authentication via OTP.

---

## Data Flow

- All data operations (add/update/delete/toggle) are routed through Supabase Edge Functions for security.
- Images are processed client-side (cropped/resized) before upload.
- Anonymous users are tracked via a cookie-based ID, sent as a header for bought status toggling.
- Admin status is determined by a valid Supabase session.

---

## Security

- Only authenticated admins can add/update/delete gifts.
- Anonymous users can only toggle bought status (no personal data stored).
- All API calls are authenticated via JWT or anonymous key as appropriate.
- No sensitive data is stored in the browser or transmitted unnecessarily.
