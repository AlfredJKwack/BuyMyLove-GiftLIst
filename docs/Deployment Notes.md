# Deployment Notes

## Current Status

✅ **Complete Implementation**
- Frontend application built with Vite + Vanilla JS + Tailwind CSS
- Supabase integration for backend (database + storage)
- Cookie-based anonymous user tracking
- Admin authentication system
- Image upload functionality
- Visitor throttling and alerting
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Comprehensive test suite (unit + E2E)

## Project Structure

The application is fully implemented with the following key components:

### Frontend (`src/`)
- `main.js` - Main application logic and UI rendering
- `style.css` - Tailwind CSS with custom component styles
- `supabase.js` - Supabase client configuration and admin auth
- `services/giftService.js` - All gift CRUD operations and business logic
- `utils/cookies.js` - Cookie utilities for anonymous user tracking

### Database Schema (`supabase-schema.sql`)
- `gifts` table - Main gift data with bought status tracking
- `daily_visitors` table - Visitor tracking for throttling
- `alerts` table - Admin notifications
- `images` storage bucket - Gift image storage

### Testing (`tests/`)
- Unit tests for cookie logic and gift operations
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
- Test setup with mocks for Supabase

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Set Up Supabase Project

1. Create account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create new project
3. Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql` in SQL Editor
4. Get project URL and anon key from Settings > Data API and API Keys respectively.
5. Verify `images` storage bucket was created

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Add your actual Supabase credentials:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_ADMIN_SECRET=your_secure_admin_password
```

### 3. Install Dependencies and Test Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Populate Database with Demo Data (Optional)

For testing and demonstration purposes, you can populate the database with sample gifts using the included script:

```bash
# Option 1: Using npm script (recommended)
npm run demo:populate

# Option 2: Run script directly
node demo/scripts/populate-demo-data.js
```

**What the script does:**
- Connects to your Supabase database using credentials from `.env.local`
- Clears any existing gifts and visitor data
- Inserts 6 sample gifts with varied bought/available status
- Adds 5 demo visitors for throttling feature testing
- Provides console output showing the populated data

**Demo gifts included:**
1. Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones (Available)
2. Smart Coffee Maker (Bought)
3. Kindle Paperwhite E-reader (Available)
4. Yoga Mat with Alignment Lines (Available)
5. Instant Pot Pressure Cooker (Bought)
6. Bluetooth Mechanical Keyboard (Available)

**Note:** This script will **clear all existing data** in the gifts and daily_visitors tables before inserting demo data. Only use this for testing/demo purposes, not in production with real data.

### 5. Deploy to Netlify/Vercel

**Netlify:**
1. Connect GitHub repo
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `dist`
4. Add environment variables in dashboard

**Vercel:**
1. Connect GitHub repo
2. Framework: Vite
3. Add environment variables in dashboard

## Features Implemented

### Core Requirements ✅
- [x] Public gift list accessible at fixed URL
- [x] Anonymous users can mark gifts as bought
- [x] Cookie-based tracking prevents unauthorized unmarking
- [x] Admin can add/edit/delete gifts
- [x] Image upload with server-side storage
- [x] Mobile-first responsive design
- [x] Visitor throttling (>12 unique visitors/day triggers alert)

### Technical Requirements ✅
- [x] Vite + Vanilla JS frontend
- [x] Tailwind CSS for styling
- [x] Supabase backend (PostgreSQL + Storage)
- [x] Environment-based configuration
- [x] Admin secrets excluded from version control
- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- [x] Comprehensive test suite

### User Experience ✅
- [x] Fast loading and interactions
- [x] Clear visual feedback for bought status
- [x] Inline admin controls
- [x] Image thumbnails in gift cards
- [x] External links open in new tabs
- [x] Mobile-optimized touch targets

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests
- Cookie utilities (set/get/generate user ID)
- Gift bought status logic
- Visitor counting and throttling logic

### E2E Tests
- Page loading and basic navigation
- Admin login workflow
- Gift management (add/edit/delete)
- Anonymous user interactions
- Mobile responsiveness
- State persistence across page reloads

## Security Considerations

- Admin authentication via environment variable
- RLS policies allow anonymous read/write with restrictions
- Cookie-based user tracking (no personal data stored)
- Image uploads to public storage bucket
- IP + cookie combination for visitor tracking
- Alert system for unusual traffic patterns

## Performance Optimizations

- Minimal JavaScript bundle (Vanilla JS)
- Tailwind CSS purging for smaller stylesheets
- Optimized images via Supabase storage
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Monitoring and Alerts

- Daily visitor tracking with automatic alerts
- Error logging to browser console
- Supabase dashboard for database monitoring
- Storage usage tracking for images

## Future Enhancements

The architecture supports easy extension for:
- OAuth authentication (Google, GitHub)
- Multiple gift lists per admin
- Email notifications for alerts
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Advanced image processing (multiple sizes)
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

## Assumptions Made

1. **Single Admin User**: Only one admin account needed initially
2. **Public Images**: All uploaded images are publicly accessible
3. **Cookie Acceptance**: Users accept cookies for functionality
4. **Modern Browsers**: Targeting ES6+ compatible browsers
5. **Supabase Hosting**: Using Supabase for all backend services

## Deviations from Spec

None - all requirements from the specification documents have been implemented as requested.
